# Inneplanter

My first "fullstack"-app I've ever built. It was meant as a way for my fianc√®e to log all her plants with the most vital data, and also be able to take a picture with her phone and upload it. It became functional, but barely. 

## Stack
- React
- NodeJS / Express
- Google Cloud
- PostgreSQL

  ### Thoughts
  I built this after learning for about three months. I didn't know what I was doing, and I relied to heavily on AI for help... So I learned a lot, but there were a lot of things that just went over my head, and if I'd taken things a bit slower I think I'd be better off today. But it was a fun project.
